                        I am currently a Junior at Claremont McKenna College, where I study Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Here, I am heavily involved in various on-campus activies. For example, I am the President of CMC Devs: <i>"CMC Devs aims to provide a community geared towards developing websites and web applications for students with little to no experience. We hope to help members gain a strong foundation in web development that allow them to expand and apply their skills to projects that they are passionate about. Our goal to create a foundation for web development so members can expand off what they have learned to create projects that are meaningful and passionate to them." </i> During our bi-weekly meetings we cover various topics related to web development, from front-end technologies like JavaScript and React.js, all the way to back-end tools like database management, and everywhere in between! Our goal is to get students with little-to-no experience interested in building and creating things from scratch, with just a plain text editor on their screen. The student's success is what motivates us to continue running this club.

                        In addition to CMC Devs, I am also involved in various other leadership positions. For example, I am currently our NCAA Division III Varisty Baseball Captain (Go Stags!). I am newly appointed for this upcoming 2019-2020 season, and hope to continue leading the Stags to a winning season, and take home some metal this year! Our team is young and hungry, and this season we will be working harder than ever to reach our goal of SCIAC Champions. Secondly, I am currently my dorms' Residential Technology Assistant (RTA). This means that I assist in all our dorm resident's technology issues such as connecting to Ethernet, Registering a MAC address, setting up various gaming consoles, and ensuring safety while browsing the internet. This position is awesome because I not only get to help people, but work with computers, too!

                    Last summer I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.feasible.io">Feasible, Inc.</a> Feasible is a battery diagnostics company, centered around the idea that in order for there to be a sustainable future, we need to analyze batteries more efficiently (cost and production). Through their ultrasonic testing and machine learning analysis, battery defects that are unseen to basic voltage testing (currently used in many large battery manufacturers) can be spotted with their EchoStat technology. During this 12-week internship, I was tasked to redesign the company's database to better-handle queries and sorts, as well as other data cleaning/pipelining tools. For example, one of my full-stack tools was built to prevent the lab testers from having to clean their own data, and prevent the signal processing scientists from cleaning <i>the lab tester's data</i>. This was build with React.js, Python (Flask), and Sqlite3 (client-side)/PostgreSQL (server-side). I was also able to do some research on Object-Relational Mapping and implement that into the tool. At the top-level, this tool would output the last run test with all important fields to both the tester and analyist, then allow an editable state for either one to make a change (hence the lack of complexity, so that the testers didn't have to memorize long SQL queries!). Overall, this internship was a great experience, and I learned so much from my mentors.

                        I attended Edmonds-Woodway High School and graduated as an International Baccalaureate Diploma Recipient with Honors. I was also named <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/sports/e-ws-mitchell-is-the-heralds-baseball-player-of-the-year/">Herald's Baseball Player of the Year</a> in 2017, and was also honored along with 16 others as an<a href="https://myedmondsnews.com/2017/05/e-ws-cooper-mackey-named-top-scholar-athletes-15-others-honored-2017-banquet/"> Edmonds Scholar-Ahtlete.</a> When I first came to CMC, I was originally studying in CMC's 3/2 program for Economics-Engineering (double) degrees, however I became kind of bored with Economics and decided to pickup a Python Crash Course Textbook from Amazon and start working through a chapter-a-day. Shortly after, I had finished the book, and began my love for programming. The next semester I took two intro courses: 1. Intro to CS at HMC, and Intro to OOP with Java at Pomona. Both were great classes, and I learned so much. I became fully invested in programming and decided to switch into Computer Science as my intended degree. However, my love for mathematics never faded, and I saw the small yet broad intersection between Applied Mathematics and CS, so I figured why not do both? Now I am studying everything I could've asked for in college.

                        I am a very detail and goal-oriented person, who is driven by the outcome of a product/project. In my spare time, I like to explore various technologies, learn new things, and do puzzles. I am also a huge fitness freak (more on the lifting side, eating is hard...). I am currently working in a mix between olympic lifting and crossfit, but enjoy any type of physical activity, whether that be hiking or rock climbing, I am all for it! Aside from fitness, I am also starting a podcast with a good buddy of mine <a href="http://students.washington.edu/shtiuif/">Fadel Shtiui.</a> Together we explore various technologies, talk about computer science in college, and geek out about other things. Our main focus as of right now is our 100 days of code challenge, where we invited programmers of all levels to participate and practice coding every day, for 100 days! We practice fundamentals, web development, python game development, other cool python libraries, some procedural programming, and other cool topics. I'll leave a link here once we are finished with everything (super close).

                    Baseball is also a huge part of my life, and have been playing since I was about six years old. I have never lost the love for the game. During my senior year in high school, our team was the first EWHS team in history to make it to the Final Four in State. We ended up coming in 4th place, but it was an amazing ride. We got to play our last few games together on the Mariner's Home field, T-Mobile Park!
