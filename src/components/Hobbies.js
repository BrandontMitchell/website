                    My favorite project I've made was a crypto currency automated bot: <a href="https://github.com/BrandontMitchell/crypto-b0t">Crypto-R2</a>. The goal of this project was actually to do a mini hackathon with some buddies of mine from Seattle, WA. However after 12 hours of coding, we realized that our setup was completely wrong (it was my friends first time using python), and spent half the time configuring various systems with the right versions of X and Y. After we coded for awhile we realized that this is actually a pretty cool idea. I was in charge of building the UI with the live bitcoin tracking in PyQT5 and Matplotlib. I was also in charge of creating the algorithm in a 'pythonic' way. Luckily the beatuiful library <a href="https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt"> CCXT</a> helped us a great deal. We also had limited testing because I didn't want to spend my friends crypto (the api was connected to his account), however we managed to get some successful transfers!
